Study Title	"NMR-based Blood Metabolic Profiles of Rats Exposed to Different Levels of Short Term Caloric Restriction"
Study Description	"Caloric restriction increases life-span of a number of different organisms including mammalian species such as dogs and rats. The underlying mechanisms are yet unknown, but appear to be related to changes of the metabolism. In order to shed more light on the metabolic response of caloric restriction we here present the first NMR-spectroscopy based study of how the blood metabolite profiles of rats are influenced by graded levels of caloric restriction. The study involved three groups of obese rats exposed for five days to 0%, 20%, and 40% caloric restriction respectively. Blood serum samples from each individual were analyzed by 1H NMR and the resulting spectra were subjected to multivariate analysis by unsupervised (PCA) and supervised (OPLS-DA) methods. The analyzes revealed that a response to caloric restriction is clearly observable already at 20% caloric restriction. The metabolites that distinguish the metabolic profiles at 20% caloric restriction deviated to some extent from those at 40% caloric restriction. The metabolic profile changes induced by caloric restriction were most clearly observed as an increased level of 3-hydroxybutyrate, and decreased levels of lipids and pyruvate. These metabolic responses are in agreement with a switch in metabolism from anabolic pathways towards fatty acid catabolism and gluconeogenesis."

Study Protocol Description	"Rats were decapitated and blood serum was prepared by allowing blood to clot before being centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 minutes."	""	"Blood serum was centrifuged and the supernatant (200 ?L) was mixed with D2O (400 ?L). The samples were analyzed at 25 �C."	"The samples were analyzed on a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer using a 5-mm 1H/13C/15N/31P QNP probe. The water suppressed spin-echo Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequence (relaxation delay-90-(t-180-t)n-acquire) was used to allow attenuation of broad signals from macromolecules, with a total CPMG time of 105 ms (n = 128). Spectra were recorded using 512 transients with 32k data points and a spectral width of 6410 Hz. Water suppression was achieved by irradiation during the relaxation delay of 3 s."	"All spectra were processed with Topspin 2.0 (Bruker). A zero-filling factor of 2 and a line-broadening of 0.5 Hz were applied to the spectra. Phasing was done automatically, followed by manual phasing if necessary, and baseline correction was automatically performed by subtraction of a polynomial of fifth degree. The signal of the anomeric proton of ?-glucose was used as a reference (? 5.233 ppm)."	""	"Spectral signals were assigned by comparison of chemical shifts with values from the literature and from the Chenomx library (Chenomx NMR Suite 7.5, Chenomx Inc., Alberta, US). In order to support the assignment of metabolite signals, DOSY, 1H,1H-TOCSY and 1H,13C-HSQC experiments were run on selected samples, which were then spiked with some of the expected metabolites."
