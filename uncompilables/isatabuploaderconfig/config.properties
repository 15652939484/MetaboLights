#�The light persistence option. If this property is set to "true", the perister skips the persistence of
#�the pipeline. This feature was introduced because such operation is still terribly slow and really unfeasible
#�for large data sets. Not storing the pipeline implies that you cannot change the database and have the changes
#�reflected by the study exporter. It also implies that the latter doesn't work at all. That is: BE CAREFUL in 
#�using it.
