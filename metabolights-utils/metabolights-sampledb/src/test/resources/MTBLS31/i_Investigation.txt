STUDY
Study Identifier	"MTBLS31"
Study Title	"Lipid Mediators of inflammation in BALF 3-19 days after infection with Influenza"
Study Description	"In this study broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from mice infected with influenza A virus, PR8 (200 PFU and 2x10^5 PFU), X31 (2x10^5 PFU) was analyzed for lipidomic host response in comparison with the mock infected animals. Time Points: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 19 days post infection, done in 8-10 replicates.)"

Study Protocol Description	"At specified time points mice were sacrificed by CO₂ inhalation. Hole was clipped in trachea, and bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) taken (3x 1ml cold 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) total). 700µL of sample was used. After SPE column the elute was in 1mL of methanol. That was then dried down to completion and taken up in 100µL buffer A (63% H₂0, 37% ACN, 0.02% Formic Acid). Sample was enriched with 10ng of each internal standard prior to extraction (100µL of 26 internal standards from 0.1ng/µL concentration solution)."	"BALF samples were supplemented with deuterated internal standards (Cayman Chemical) and the lipid metabolites were isolated by solid phase extraction on a C18 column."	"The extracted samples were evaporated, reconstituted in a small volume and the eicosanoids were separated by reverse phase LC using a Synergy C18 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA)."	"The eicosanoids were analyzed by tandem quadrupole MS (MDS SCIEX 4000 QTRAP, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) operated in the negative-ionization mode via multiple-reaction monitoring."	"Data was normalized and calculated from total ng to pmol/mL using a standard curve."	"Authentic standards were analyzed under identical conditions and eicosanoid quantitation was achieved by the stable isotope dilution method."	"Data analysis was performed using the MultiQuant 2.1 software (Applied Biosystems)."
