<h2><spring:message code="msg.importmetabolites.title"/></h2>

    <p>This page will allow you to import compound from chebi scanning, from a given compound, all the tree down to it's leaves. It will do a HAS_ROLE and for each entry returned will follow the IS_A, IS_TAUTOMER_OF, IS_CONJUGATE_ACID_OF and IS_CONJUGATE_BASE_OF.
