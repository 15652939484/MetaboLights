<H3>LipidHome</H3>

<div class="grid_24">
  <a href="/metabolights/lipidhome"/>LipidHome</a> is a database of theoretical lipid structures derived from a seed set of lipid sub classes and some lipid chemical space constraints agreed upon with experts in the field. Lipids are organised according to a combination of the LIPID MAPS ontology and the recent publication by the LipidomicNet consortium <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23667450"/>(Liebisch G, Vizca√≠no JA, Koefeler H, Troztmueller M, Griffiths WJ, Schmitz G, Spener F, Wakelam MJO (2012) Short notation for lipid structures derived from mass spectrometry. J Lipid Res In press.)</a>
