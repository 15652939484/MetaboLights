DEPLOYING STEPS
Thing to do before deploying

1.- Change header and footer iFrame source:

	STEPS:
	
	* Open WEB-INF/jsp/layout.jsp
	* Replace <iframe src="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/inc/head.html" with <iframe src="/inc/head.html"
	* Replace <iframe src="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/inc/foot.html" with <iframe src="/inc/foot.html"
	 
	REASON:
	The line <iframe src="/inc/head.html" in layout.jsp does not work if your are not deployed on 
	the EBI file system. So instead, we use the line <iframe src="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/inc/head.html"
	This then gives the header on our workstation deployment, but its drop down menu drops behind.
	It can't be fixed locally, but on real deployment the menu works okay if you swicth back to 
	<iframe src="/inc/head.html..
