DEPLOYING STEPS


********************************
Things to do before deploying
********************************

1.- Change header and footer iFrame source:

	STEPS:
	
	* Open WEB-INF/jsp/layout.jsp
	* Replace <iframe src="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/inc/head.html" with <iframe src="/inc/head.html"
	* Replace <iframe src="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/inc/foot.html" with <iframe src="/inc/foot.html"
	 
	REASON:
	The line <iframe src="/inc/head.html" in layout.jsp does not work if your are not deployed on 
	the EBI file system. So instead, we use the line <iframe src="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/inc/head.html"
	This then gives the header on our workstation deployment, but its drop down menu drops behind.
	It can't be fixed locally, but on real deployment the menu works okay if you swicth back to 
	<iframe src="/inc/head.html.. 

2.- Change the dataSource under spring-servlet.  Make sure the JNDI dataSource is configured, 
	eg. the dataSoruce for the local database parameters is commented out!  

3.-	Check that the correct dataSource is selected, see point 2!

4.- Make the war file (Eclipse):
	STEPS:
	* Right click on project metabolights-webapp
	* Click export and choose "war".
	* Choose the name you want (metabolights.war, metabolights-dev.war, metabolights-test.war), 
	  Store this file under /nfs/production/panda/metabolights/deploy, if not here you can not test 
	  tomcat deployment as it is on the cluster!
