Dear {1},

Thank you for your interest in MetaboLights

Your new MetaboLights account "{0}" has been activated.

Here is a quick start guide, but please let us know on metabolights-help@ebi.ac.uk if we can help you further.

Quick start guide:
- We use ISAcreator to capture metabolomics metadata and raw files, which needs to be downloaded and installed. You can download a complete package from our ftp link here (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/metabolights/submissionTool/ISAcreatorMetaboLights.zip)
- Once downloaded and unzipped, look at the examples in the ISAcreator directory and use one as a template to speed up metadata filling. Please use "run_WIN.cmd" to run on Windows, "run_MAC.command" on Mac or "run_LINUX.sh" on Linux, this will preserve all special characters
- Our submission page is at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/presubmit
